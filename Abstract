It has been noticed that the number of diabetic patients is increasing day by day from
young to old people. According to WHO (World health organization), the number of people with 
diabetes has increased over the years. Diabetes can cause many problems to the body if it 
remains unidentified and untreated. Therefore, it is very important to have an accurate system, 
through which diabetes doesn’t go undetected and it accurately classifies patients with diabetes 
or no diabetes. The objective of this project is to train various classification models on patients'
data and compare the performance of these models to see which classification technique 
performs better and predicts accurately, that is, classifying patients with diabetes and patients 
with no diabetes, with maximum accuracy. To do this we will use different classification 
methods, such as Naïve Bise, Decision tree, Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, 
and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis. And, then we will evaluate the performance of these 
models using various evaluation metrics.
